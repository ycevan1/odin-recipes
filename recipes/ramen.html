        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a very simple Tonkotsu Ramen recipe. However, it will take some time 
            to make in order to get the best flavor out of this dish. It will take a little
            effort, but trust me, it will be totally worth it.
        </p>
        <p>Perfectly bouncy noodles. Silky smooth runny eggs. Lovely smelling pork. 
            And Umami rich broth.
        </p>

            <li>thinly sliced green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Chashu pork belly</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb pork belly - rolled and tied</li>

            <li>1/2 cup sake</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mirin</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Soy bacon tare</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices bacon </li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp sake</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp shiro miso</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Miso Tare</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup shiro miso</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sake</li>
            <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
            <li>pinch shichimi togarashi</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Chashu pork belly</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a 
                ziploc bag large enough to hold the pork belly. Stick a straw in the 
                bag and seal the ziploc bag up against it (so the straw is the only 
                opening). Suck as much of the air out as you can and seal.
            </li>
            <li>Sous vide the pork for 10-11 hours at 170F.</li>
            <li>Remove pork from the ziploc bag. Discard the bag and marinade.</li>
            <li>Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.</li>
            <li>
                Slice across the chashu pork (so you get bacon like slices) - 
                into 8-12 slices about 1/8 to 3/16 inches thick. Reserve. 
                You won't need all the pork for 4 servings.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Soy bacon tare</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at the 
                lowest setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken stock 
                if needed.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the bacon.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Medium boiled eggs</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil. If you have a way 
                to prick the eggshell do it. Boil large eggs for 6 minutes 30 seconds. 
                If using extra large eggs boil them for 7 minutes 30 seconds. You may 
                have to adjust your times slightly depending on the exact size of your 
                eggs but this should get you pretty close.
            </li>
            <li>
                Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops the egg 
                yolks from continuing to set up. Peel. Cut in half right before you 
                serve your tonkotsu ramen.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Assemble the tonkotsu ramen</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the packaging. 
                If there's no translation on the packaging usually its 4 minutes. You 
                don't need to salt the water.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles - you just want them softened.</li>
            <li>Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.</li>
            <li>Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls and stir to mix.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles. Pour in another 1 1/2 cups of the tonkotsu broth per bowl.</li>
            <li>Top with the egg, mushrooms, pork and green onions.</li>
        </ol>
